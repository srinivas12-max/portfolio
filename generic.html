								<h3><u>EMCAD (Electro-Mechanical Compact Automatic Duster).</u></h3>
								<div class="image"><img src="images/The-BLUE-BOX.jpg" alt="" height="250" width="250"/></div>
								<p>Majority of the educational institutions still adopt chalk-board teaching in their classrooms where frequent wiping of boards with duster is inevitable. Teachers often cleans the duster either inside or outside of the classroom causing dust allergy and also the aesthetics of the surrounding. <br/>This device collects dust from chalk-dusters into a confined space, from here the collected chalk dust can be filtered and made into a new chalk.</p>
								<u>Challenges faced</u>
								<p>
								<ul>
								<li>Making the design simple, cost efficient and affordable for schools and colleges.</li>
								<li>Design complexity to make it smaller in size.</li>
								</ul>
								</p>
								
								<h3><u>Design and Development of Solar Powered Public Utility Chair with Multi Charging Port.</u></h3>
								<div class="image"><img src="images/chair.jpg" alt="" height="250" width="250"/></div>
								<p>Open lounge space in public parks, educational institutions and other public places provide excellent ambiance for relaxation and to attend to personal assignment through electronic accessories. However, lack of charging stations at such places is a great disadvantage to people who prefer such an ambiance. In order to address this issue it is proposed to design a public utility chair or a new seating systems fed with solar energy with the capability to provide charging ports for laptops and mobile phones.
									<br/>The designed system will have battery backup with number of protective features and also weather proof cover for vital electronic parts and ports.
								</p>
								<u>Challenges faced</u>
								<p>
								<ul>
								<li>This system involves, calculation of peak power demand, design of battery charger, sizing of battery and solar panels, dc to dc converter with PWM, and design of aesthetically pleasing chair.</li>
								</ul>

								<h3><u>Stroke Rehabilitation Glove.</u></h3>

								<div class="image"><img src="images/glove1.png" alt="" height="250" width="250"/></div>
								<p>Despite the of several stroke rehabilitation devices, there is a need for a system which is comprehensive, compact and worthwhile. The backdrops in the current rehabilitation devices are that they are complex, bulky in nature and are high-priced. In order to overcome these limitations an innovative electronic glove system has been prototyped to aid finger impairment in post stroke patients. The results obtained by this can be analyzed using a data-scale. This lucid system can be used by doctors, physiotherapists to get qualitative results.</p>
								<u>Challenges faced</u>
								<p>
								<ul>
									<li>Making the system compact, so it can be just like wearing a glove. </li>
									<li>Cost effectiveness</li>
									<li>Readiness of use</li>
									<li>To make system transferable and reusable. </li>
								</ul>
								</p>

								<h3><u>Developing a Laser Guided missile System.</u></h3>

								<div class="image"><img src="images/missile.png" alt="" height="250" width="250"/></div>
								<p>A guidance device consists of devices that are implemented on controlling the
									movement of a missile or other moving object. Every movement within the missile
									from the start line till it reaches the target is about and goes past the system. Here we
									are studying a laser-guided system for the missile by Implementation. Guidance is that the process of
									calculating the initial and changes in its position, velocity, altitude, and rotation rates
									of a moving object within the air required to follow a particular trajectory</p>
								<u>Challenges faced</u>
								<p>
								<ul>
									<li>Selection of hardware and material.</li>
									<li>Cost effectiveness.</li>
									<li>Accuracy & Pression.</li>
									<li>Intensive programming.</li>
								</ul>
